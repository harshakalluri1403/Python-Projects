# Python Projects
This repository contains various Python projects that demonstrate different applications, including a rule-based chatbot, image captioning using deep learning, and an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Projects:
1. CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
2. IMAGE CAPTIONING
3. TIC-TAC-TOE AI



### CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
This is a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. The chatbot uses pattern matching techniques to identify specific keywords or phrases in the user's input and generates appropriate responses accordingly.
Features:
Rule-based responses based on keyword matching
Easily customizable rules
Supports multiple input patterns

### IMAGE CAPTIONING
Description:
This project implements an image captioning system using deep learning techniques. The model takes an image as input and generates descriptive captions based on the contents of the image. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for caption generation.
Features:
Uses a pre-trained CNN for image feature extraction
RNN-based caption generation
Can be extended to use different datasets

### TIC-TAC-TOE AI
Description:
This is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best possible moves and plays optimally, ensuring that it never loses.
Features:
Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer AI
AI uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal play
Simple command-line interface
